# **PRINCIPAL'S MESSAGE**

“Sawubona” is a common greeting in the Zulu tribe.  It literally means “I see you, you are important to me and I value you”.   This is an important value, a way to make the other person visible and to accept them as they are with their virtues, nuances, and flaws.  Our Montfort education has always focused on the inculcation of virtues in our boys, through our CHRISTE values and for the boys to be of service to the larger community.  Encapsulated in our school mission, we immerse our students in our Montfortian Education Charter and spirituality.  We nurture each child to explore his potential, discover his gifts, and be inspired to carry himself as a Man for Others.  
  
Guided by our charter, Montfort Junior School seeks to provide a balanced and well-rounded education. We want to give every child the opportunity to practice living out our school motto, Age Quod Agis, in every aspect of their lives.  We prepare the boys for their future by giving them the opportunity to put into daily practice the skills and dispositions that will carry them throughout their lives.  We design many opportunities for the boys to ignite their passion, their joy of learning, and for them to take their individual responsibility to explore their potential every day.  This is the meaning of Age Quod Agis, to do their best in whatever they do.  
  
Montfort Junior School will need our community to come together to provide the best educational experience for our children. We need our stakeholders – Our Montfort Brothers of St Gabriel’s, Saint Gabriel’s Foundation, Montfort Secondary School, Montfortian Gabrielite Educational Institutions, Montfort Alumni, with all our parents – to journey with the boys as this will give our children a connected, enriched, and meaningful schooling experience.  
  
I am honored to be given the opportunity to serve as Principal of Montfort Junior School. Together, let us work for, and walk with the boys, their journey to discover what it means to live out our Montfort’s CHRISTE values and to do their best in whatever they do.  
  

Mr Victor Tan, Principal
