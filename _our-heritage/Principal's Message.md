2021 marks our 105th year of founding. Our Founder – St Louis Marie Gringnion de Montfort, had a vision to set up charitable schools and he said “Schools are the nursery-gardens of the Church, in which children, like little trees, are pruned and trained with care, that they may bring forth good fruit.”  
  
It is a matter of pride that our staff continue to live up to that vision and continue that legacy of care and excellence for our young Montfortians. We continue to develop, remind and inspire our young Montfortians that they have a role and responsibility to contribute back to society and to be a **Man For Others.**   
  
Starting from humble beginnings, Montfort Junior has grown from strength to strength. Never resting on our laurels, we continue to look forward to the future to identify areas of growth and opportunities so that our students will be future ready and grounded in values.  
  
In Montfort Junior, we frame our holistic curriculum under three guiding principles: value centric, boy centric and future centric.  
  
**Value Centric:**  
Montfort Junior adopts the values of our Founder, St Louis Marie De Montfort as our school values. The acronym **CHRISTE** sums up our values of **C**ompassion, **H**umility, **R**espect, **I**ntegrity, **S**ervice, **T**eam spirit and **E**xcellence. We hold the belief that for any child to be developed to be A Man for Others, he must be anchored in values. This is why we make full use of every opportunity to bring in our school values and share with our students how these values can be practiced. We also make it a point to engage their parents to work in partnership with the school to inculcate these values. Together as a community, we work to build up our next generation to be useful members of society.  
  
**Boy Centric:**  
Being an all-boys institution, we structure our curriculum to cater to the learning preferences of our boys. This will mean the inclusion of time for experiential learning, elements of brain based learning, lots of group work and use of technology. Our program offerings are also differentiated to meet the interests and needs of our boys. Boys do learn differently and we have tapped on research to guide us in offering a whole school environment that allows each boy to develop at his own pace.  
  
**Future Centric:**  
Our role is to prepare our boys for the future. In a fast changing and complex future, one can never be certain on what type of jobs will be available for our boys. However what we can be certain of is that our boys will need to be equipped with future-proof mindsets and skillsets that will serve them well for the future. We have a comprehensive 6 year program that exposes all our students to Computational Thinking, Design Thinking principles and emerging technology. Through our Maker Education initiative, we also develop in our students the necessary mindsets such as resilience, be failure positive and to be innovative. We believe that through our programs, our boys will develop the confidence to take on whatever challenges that the future throws at them.  
  
We have a strong and vibrant school program and we are constantly looking out for the sparkle in our student’s eyes. We look forward to greater parental engagement and we encourage all parents to take up the many invitations to be involved in our school’s programs and to be a part of the Montfortian family.  
  
The Montfort story is one of Love, Care and Service. We have transformed the lives of multitudes who now follow in the footsteps of our Founder, to be a light to the World. We come together as a community to nurture fine young men, one boy at a time, to be A Man for Others.
