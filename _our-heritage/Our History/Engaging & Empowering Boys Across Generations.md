# **ENGAGING & EMPOWERING BOYS ACROSS GENERATIONS**

We celebrated our 103rd Founder’s Day on 27 April 2019.  At the Founder’s Day celebration, the Montfort Heritage Documentary, entitled: A Lifelong Mission of Moulding Men for Others was launched.  It marks both the Singapore Bicentenary and our 103rd  Anniversary.    The documentary tells the story of how the school has been grooming Montfortians to serve Singapore’s society as scholars, sportsmen, gentlemen and leaders over generations. It features heartwarming anecdotes from staff, parents, students as well as alumni who have proudly walked through our gates over the decades.
