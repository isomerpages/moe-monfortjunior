# **MONTFORTIAN EDUCATION CHARTER**

![](/images/Montfortian%20Education%20Charter.png)

The Montfortian Education Charter (MEC) is a very precious document for us as schools of the Montfort Brothers of St. Gabriel. This version of the MEC is adapted for our use in the context of our schools here in Singapore. It upholds for us the tenets that guide us as we strive to be a school or institution that is creatively faithful to the Montfortian Inspiration.

**Vision Statement**

Montfortian education has the person in society at its centre. It transforms individuals and communities to be spiritually inspired, respect the community of life, be fraternal in orientation, and just in all relationships. The goal of Montfortian education is to form enlightened and harmonious persons committed to a just and fraternal world.

**Mission Statement**

Inspired by the mission of Jesus to proclaim the good news to the poor, liberty to captives, sight to the blind, and to set at liberty those who are oppressed (Lk.4:18-19), Montfortian education in its different forms is committed to the empowerment of youth, particularly the poor (C 89), and all those struggling for justice (C 92). It seeks transformation and self-realization of the person at the intellectual, moral, spiritual and social levels to be able to contribute to the world in its quest for respect for the community of life, longing for just and fraternal relationships, and attaining sustainable development.
