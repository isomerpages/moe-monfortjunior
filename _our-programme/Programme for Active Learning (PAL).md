# **PROGRAMME FOR ACTIVE LEARNING (PAL)**

Montfort Junior School formally embarked on Programme for Active Learning (PAL) in 2017 for the Primary 1 and Primary 2 pupils. In our school, we hope that the PAL programme can further develop and help our pupils to grow to become a scholar, sportsman, gentleman and leader. (S.S.G.L)  
  
The purpose of PAL (an initiative from MOE) is three-fold:  
 
1\.  It provides pupils with broad **exposure and experiences** through fun and varied activities in Sports & Games, Outdoor Education, Performing Arts and Visual Arts.     
2\.  It facilitates the **holistic development** of pupils in the five domains of **physical, cognitive, social, aesthetics and moral.**    
3\.  It provides varied avenues for pupils to develop **social-emotional** competencies. 

There are 3 periods set aside each week where pupils will be exposed to broad learning experiences in the 4 domains. (Outdoor Education, Visual Arts, Performing Arts (Music & Dance), Sports and Games)  
  
The weekly PAL lessons in Montfort Junior School are experiential by nature. They provide our pupils with kinesthetic and tactile experiences so as to reinforce their cognitive and conceptual learning. The packages for the various modules are designed by our teachers and customized to the needs of our pupils. We also apply our boy-centric pedagogy in our lessons design to incorporate values education and social emotional learning through fun and enjoyable activities.
