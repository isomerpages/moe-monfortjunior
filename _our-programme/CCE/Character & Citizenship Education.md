# **CHARACTER & CITIZENSHIP EDUCATION**

![](/images/CCE%20dept.jpg)

Character & Citizenship Education (CCE) aims to inculcate values and build social and emotional competencies in students to develop them to be good individuals and useful citizens. The CCE Department focuses on character development based on our school’s CHRISTE value so as to develop Montfortian Scholars, Sportsmen, Gentlemen and Leaders and to achieve our Vision of nurturing our boys to become A Man For Others.

****Our Montfortian CHRISTE Values :****

**C ompassion**    
 **H umility**   
 **R espect**    
 **I ntegrity**    
 **S ervice**    
 **T eamspirit**    
 **E xcellence**

Values education is integrated into the various instructional programmes as well as co-curricular programmes. In line with our boys-centric education, we believe that boys learn values best through the experiential way, by engaging their head, heart and hands.

### MONTFORT CHARACTER AND CITIZENSHIP EDUCATION

In our weekly Montfort Character & Citizenship Education (MCCE) lessons, the students are taught values, social emotional competencies and life-skills. These lessons incorporate the Form Teacher Guidance Programme (FTGP) lesson packages and the life story of our patron saint, St. Louis Marie de Montfort.

Life-skills programmes such as Cyberwellness, Career Awareness, Sexuality Education and Environment Education are platforms for pupils to learn values.    

In these lessons, we also promote the building of positive relationship amongst pupils and teachers. Time is set aside for the class to have breakfast together and play together.
