**Our Vision**

Develop confident teachers and pupils who will teach and learn the English language with a passion. They will be equipped with the skills not only to achieve excellence in English but to be innovative, creative and dare to take the language beyond the walls of their classrooms. We aim to develop every Montfortian to be empathetic communicators, discerning readers and creative inquirers by equipping them with 21st century competencies.  
  
**Aims and Rationale**  

The aims of teaching the English Language in the primary school are to enable pupils to:  
1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Listen to, read and view critically and with accuracy, understanding and appreciation a wide array of literary and informational texts in standard English from print, non-print and digital networked sources.&nbsp;  
  
2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Speak, write and represent in standard English that is grammatical, fluent, intelligible and appropriate for different purposes, audiences, contexts and cultures. &nbsp;  
  
3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Use standard English grammar and vocabulary accurately and appropriately, and understand how speakers/writers put words together and use language to communicate meaning and achieve impact.  
4) English with impact, effect and affect.  

**STELLAR**  
To inculcate a love for reading and to have a strong foundation in the English Language,  
Montfort Junior School has implemented STELLAR (Strategies for English Language Learning and Reading programme)&nbsp;for the whole school.  
  
In this programme, teaching and learning of English is carried out using more speaking and listening activities.&nbsp;Our pupils learn reading and writing using rich and interesting books, with discussions led by the teacher.  
  
This programme focuses on children's interaction rather than on teacher talk, explicit instruction of grammar and early&nbsp;literacy skills while providing a rich language environment through the use of a variety of print and non-print materials&nbsp;which will be provided by the school.  


**Shared Book Approach (SBA)**     
There are two parts to the Shared Book Approach. In SBA 1, the teacher introduces and shares a Big Book with the pupils.&nbsp;In SBA 2, the teacher teaches grammar and vocabulary explicitly, including concepts of print and phonics using the&nbsp;Big Book that was used in SBA 1. There are also a range of follow-up activities such as drama and art and craft for pupils to carry out.
