# **TAMIL LANGUAGE**

![](/images/TL%20Dept_1.jpg)

### DEPARTMENT OBJECTIVES:

*   To ensure every student develop skills of a confident and effective communicator for the Tamil Language.
*   To enhance language learning through an integrated approach towards ICT based lessons & other learning techniques.
*   To make learning of Tamil  language relevant by promoting the richness of its values & cultural heritage.

### VISION

To touch both the **hearts and minds of the young** so as to achieve the desired outcomes of an **holistic education**. 

### MISSION

To develop students into confident, collaborative and curious learners  through **Ability driven approach** catering to different passions and talents/skills of the students and thus developing creative thinkers and lifelong learners.

### TEACHING APPROACHES

A variety of learning approaches and activities are organized, designed and taught to develop proficient users who can communicate effectively using the language in real-life contexts and apply it in inter-personal communication, so as to make TL directly relevant to students and a living language. Such activities include more performance-based tasks (show-n-tell, story-telling, poetry recital, group work, role play and games).    
  
We leverage on our students’ familiarity and regular use of ICT for TL learning. There is greater use of ICT platforms such as SLS, IMTL and Vaandu to create realistic, interactive settings that test students’ ability to use the language effectively and meaningfully.  
  
Holistic Assessment (HA) - ongoing feedback to learners on how the can improve their learning. Formative approaches (e.g. skilful questioning techniques, regular and timely feedback, parking lots, self and peer assessment) are integrated into everyday teaching and learning to help enhance students’ learning.

### INDOOR & OUTDOOR CLASSROOM ACTIVITIES:

Lessons come alive and it’s full of fun over at Montfort Junior School! An immersive language environment is offered to enable students to learn Tamil with confidence and joy.
