# **GUITAR CLUB**
If you have always enjoyed listening to the sound of classical or acoustic guitar, this is the place to be. Playing the guitar also trains you to be responsible, disciplined and promotes team spirit and excellence as you have to coordinate with your friends to sound great as a team.  
  
We are proud to have experienced and dedicated instructors who have been working with the students for the past 8 years. Opportunities are available for students to participate in the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) and for school events such as PAM Night and Founders Day.
