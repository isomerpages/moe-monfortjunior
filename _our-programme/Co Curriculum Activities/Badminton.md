# **BADMINTON**

Badminton has been the schoolâ€™s niche sports CCA since the 1980s. We have the School Team and the Developmental Team (Primary 1 to 4) for competitive play, and the recreational team to cater for leisure play.

The School Team is proud to have experienced and devoted coaches who have close ties with the school. Opportunities are always available for school team players to participate in school and open competitions, thus promoting resilience, perseverance, and team spirit in pursuing the sports that they love.
