# **PICASSO'S PALS**

Picasso’s Pals is an artistic platform for student to enjoy art under skilful instructors. Our students are able to develop their artistic expressions through the art-making processes. Besides nurturing the students’ love for art, they would have the opportunity to participate in exhibitions and leave behind a legacy that will become a rich part of our Montfort Junior's school culture.

Picasso's Pals students will be working on two separate projects. A large-scale mural painting on the exterior walls of the Indoor Sport Hall and a collaborative artwork in the Cubist art style which will a part of our school's submission to the Singapore Youth Festival 2023. In both projects, our students will get to pick up different artistic skills that are taught during the CCA sessions.
