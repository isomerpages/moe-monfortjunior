# **Co-Curriculum Activities in Montfort Junior School**

In Montfort, we strongly encourage every student to participate in a CCA as it helps to strengthen the school values as our emphasis is on character building.  
  

CCA also provides your son an opportunity to represent the school as an individual or as a team in competitions, performances and&nbsp;Values In Actions VIA) projects. Through this exposure, we believe he will be a more confident person who is resilient and is able to contribute back to the community.

We are pleased to inform you that we have also included Modular CCA during curriculum time (Wednesday mornings) for all Primary 3 to Primary 6 students.

These are the CCAs available in Montfort for the different levels.
