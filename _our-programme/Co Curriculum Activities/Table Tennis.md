# **TABLE TENNIS**

Table Tennis CCA aims to provide our students with opportunities to experience and excel in the game. We provide opportunities for students who seek for competitive participation or enjoy the game as a leisure sport. 
 
The School Team is proud to have experienced coaches who provides rigorous training to hone the skills of our students. Opportunities are always available for school team players to participate in school and other competitions.

The Recreational table tennis sessions provides a platform for members to play leisurely and develop their skills with their coaches and CCA team members.
