# **FOOTBALL**

Football is a popular sports CCA for MJS students. To cater for competitive and leisure play, the school has partnered the coaches to craft specific training plans to develop the School Team and the Developmental Team (Primary 1 to 4). We are proud to have experienced and devoted coaches who have close ties with the school. 

Various opportunities are provided according to the skillset of our students, including participation in the Montfort Sports Excellence (MSPEX) program where our students attend sports modules conducted by various sportsmen to learn about the conditioning and mindset required of athletes. To gain competition exposure, our students participate in friendlies, invitational competitions and National School Games tournaments. 

Such exposure will develop a sense of resilience, spirit of excellence and team spirit in pursuing the sports that they love.
