# **TAEKWONDO**

Taekwondo is a Korean martial art with a heavy emphasis on head-height kicks, jumping and spinning kicks and fast kicking techniques. Taekwondo not only strengthens the body and spirit, it can also cultivate self-discipline during the course of learning the sport.

Montfort students participating in this sport learn the CHRISTE values while mastering the skills and training for the different belt colours.Â We have experienced instructors for our budding students who are interested in learning Taekwondo.
