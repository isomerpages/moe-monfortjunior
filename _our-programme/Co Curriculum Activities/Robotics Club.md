# **ROBOTICS CLUB**



Our students are trained to build robots using LEGO’s Spike Prime core set and use their coding skills to program the robots to complete the different missions assigned to them weekly. 

Students possessing the right attitude and aptitude will be selected to participate in the annual National Robotics Competition which will be held at the Singapore Science Centre during the September holidays. 

To provide our members with greater exposure, 2 teams from MJS will also be partaking in the First Lego League (FLL) Challenge in April 2023. Every year, the FLL Challenge is based on a theme and the theme for 2023 is SUPERPOWERED. 

In the SUPERPOWERED challenge, teams will explore where energy comes from and how it is distributed, stored and used – and channel their superpowered creativity to work to innovate towards a better energy future.
