# **BOYS CENTRIC EDUCATION**

Boy-Centric Education (BCE) is the Teaching and Learning framework of MJS. Our teachers are skilled to know the boys – our learners, and we aim to provide a fun-enriching learning experience for them. 

We design our lessons aligned to brain-based learning theories to suit the needs of an all-boys education. 

**Our BCE Structured lessons include:**

*   Social Interaction (collaborative / cooperative)
*   Visual learning, Relevance of literary material
*   Single task focus, Structured sessions
*   Student ownership, Modelling/demo
*   Technology integration
*   Kinaesthetic learning
*   Arts integration
*   Interim projects
*   Write-to-learn / practices
*   Music/Movement/Breaks
*   Challenges/Competitions
*   Self-regulation strategies
*   Routines/rituals.
