<h1><strong>Science</strong></h1>
<h4><strong>Vision and Mission</strong></h4>
<p>Through the love and passion for Science, we aspire for our Montfortians
to develop a spirit of <strong>inquiry</strong> and <strong>innovation</strong>,
a heart to serve others in our community and to <strong>inspire </strong>and
play an active role in caring for the environment.</p>

<p>This is in line with our school’s vision and mission to fulfil one’s fullest
potential and to be a man for others, as well as MOE’s science curriculum
