<h1><strong>Science</strong></h1>
<h4><strong>Vision and Mission</strong></h4>
<p>Through the love and passion for Science, we aspire for our Montfortians
to develop a spirit of <strong>inquiry</strong> and <strong>innovation</strong>,
a heart to serve others in our community and to <strong>inspire </strong>and
play an active role in caring for the environment.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This is in line with our school’s vision and mission to fulfil one’s fullest
potential and to be a man for others, as well as MOE’s science curriculum
framework as shown.</p>

<h4><strong>Learning through</strong> <strong><em>Making</em></strong></h4>
<p>Designed for the youngest Montfortians in our school, it encompasses a
series of activities, conceptualized to concretize scientific concepts
for our little ones. The P1 &amp; P2 students engage in activities to learn
about the amazing stages in the life cycle of butterflies, the wide variety
of species of animals and their characteristics and also tinker with magnets.</p>

<p>In addition, students are given various opportunities to embark on Science
projects and competitions on various themes such as “engineering science”
for students to further develop their 21<sup>st </sup>Century Competencies
(CC) through STEM exposure.</p>

<h4><strong>Learning through</strong> <strong><em>Growing</em></strong></h4>
<p>The school embarks on a project whereby vertical gardening towers were
set up for the students to grow herbs and vegetables organically. The students
would appreciate the importance of biodiversity and understand how land
scarce Singapore can make use of technology as a farming method. The towers
also serve as a platform for character building and values education as
it can help to foster a love and respect for the environment and to understand
the importance of sustainability in farming practices in Singapore.</p>

<p>To further encourage our students to love and respect the environment,
the school has revamped our eco-gardens such that our students can grow
vegetables, mushrooms and herbs. We have also embarked on the eco-stewardship
programme starting from the P3s, to nurture them early on the importance
of moving towards a sustainable future.</p>

<h4><strong>Learning through</strong> <strong><em>Seeing, Doing and Thinking</em></strong></h4>
<p>Learning comes alive as our students experience the Ways of Thinking and
Doing Science (WoTD) and apply their 21<sup>st</sup> CC in their classrooms
with the effective use of various Science experiment and activity Kits.</p>

to learn beyond their classroom and even within the school itself.</p>
